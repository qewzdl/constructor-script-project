# Production Deployment Quickstart

This guide explains how to launch the Constructor Script CMS on a public server with automatic HTTPS in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

- A server running Linux with ports **80** and **443** exposed to the internet.
- A DNS A/AAAA record that points your domain (e.g. `blog.example.com`) to the server.
- Docker Engine 20.10+ and the Docker Compose plugin (`docker compose`).
- An email address that can receive Let's Encrypt expiry notices.

## One-command setup

```bash
./deploy/quickstart.sh blog.example.com admin@example.com "My Blog"
```

The script performs the following:

1. Generates secure credentials for PostgreSQL and JWT signing.
2. Creates `deploy/.env.production` containing production-ready defaults.
3. Builds the CMS Docker image and starts three containers:
   - **postgres** – persistent PostgreSQL 15 database.
   - **api** – the Go-based CMS backend.
   - **caddy** – automatically obtains and renews HTTPS certificates via Let's Encrypt and proxies traffic to the API.
4. Persists data in Docker volumes (`postgres_data`, `uploads_data`, `caddy_data`, `caddy_config`).

Once the containers are up, the site becomes available at `https://<your-domain>` as soon as DNS resolves to the server.

## Customisation

- To change environment values, edit `deploy/.env.production` and re-run `docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.production -f deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`.
- Uploaded media is stored in the `uploads_data` volume. You can back it up with `docker run --rm -v constructor-script-project_uploads_data:/data busybox tar -czf - -C /data . > uploads.tgz`.
- Stop the stack with `docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.production -f deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml down`. Add `-v` to remove the volumes (this deletes the database and uploads).

## Troubleshooting

- Check container logs: `docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f`.
- Ensure ports 80/443 are open and DNS is correctly configured; Caddy cannot obtain certificates otherwise.
- Regenerate configuration by re-running the quickstart script. It will prompt before overwriting the existing `.env.production` file.
